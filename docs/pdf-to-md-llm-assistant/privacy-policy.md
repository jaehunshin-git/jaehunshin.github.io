### 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains what information is handled by the "PDF to MD - LLM Assistant" Chrome extension ("the Extension"), for what purposes and legal bases, how it is shared, transferred, secured, and retained, and what rights are available to you under applicable laws, including Korea’s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The Extension prioritizes local processing, data minimization, and full compliance with the Chrome Web Store’s “Limited Use” policy.

### 2. Data Controller

- **Controller:** Jaehun Shin (Developer)
- **Contact:** jhshin0422@gmail.com

If you have any questions or wish to exercise your rights, please contact us via the email above. Including relevant details will help us handle your request promptly.

### 3. Key Privacy Principles

- **Local-First Processing:** All PDF files and their content are processed locally within your browser. They are never transmitted to our servers.
- **Data Minimization:** We only handle the minimum data necessary for the stated purposes.
- **No Sale or Advertising Use:** Your data is never sold or used for personalized advertising or credit profiling.

### 4. Personal Data We Handle, Purposes, and Legal Bases

The Extension does not collect or store any personal data during the ordinary use of its core conversion features. In the limited context of Pro license activation and restoration, the following data is handled based on contract performance and our legitimate interest in providing and securing our service:

| Context | Data Item | Purpose of Processing | Retention Period |
|---|---|---|---|
| **License Activation** | License Key | To verify the validity of a Pro license. | Deleted immediately after verification. |
| **Purchase Restoration** | License Key, Email Address | To find and restore a user's previous purchase record. | Deleted immediately after verification. |
| **Browser Sync Storage** | Pro Activation Status (a simple true/false flag) | To sync your Pro status across your devices. | Stored until you deactivate or uninstall the extension. |

*Users who do not wish to provide this information may simply choose not to use the Pro features or the purchase restoration function.*

### 5. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data, except where strictly necessary for payment processing and license verification. We do not share data for advertising or any other secondary purpose. As the developer, I do not personally view, access, or store your license key or email address during this automated verification process. The data is handled exclusively by the secure, automated backend function for the sole purpose of verification with the third-party services.

| Recipient / Vendor | Country | Data Transmitted | Purpose | Legal Basis | Data Policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gumroad Inc.** | USA | During purchase: payment info, email address. | To process Pro license purchases. | Contract Fulfillment | See Gumroad's policies. |
| **Google LLC** | Global | License Key, Email (for restoration only). | To serve as a secure backend proxy for license verification. | Service Operation | See Google's policies. |

### 6. International Data Transfers

For Pro license verification, your license key (and email, for restoration) may be processed on Google’s global cloud infrastructure. For purchases, your payment data is processed by Gumroad, Inc. in the United States. All transfers are protected with strong encryption (HTTPS/TLS) and are handled according to international data transfer standards as implemented by our providers.

### 7. Data Security

We are committed to protecting your data. All network transmissions are encrypted with HTTPS/TLS. Data collection and access are minimized to what is strictly necessary. Our third-party providers, Google and Gumroad, implement industry-standard security controls, including encryption-at-rest and access monitoring.

### 8. Your Rights

Under applicable laws like GDPR and PIPA, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data, as well as the right to restrict or object to its processing. Since we immediately delete verification data, these rights primarily apply to the Pro status flag stored in your browser, which you can delete by uninstalling the extension. For any requests, please contact us at the email provided above.

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority, such as the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) in Korea or the relevant authority in your EU member state.

### 9. Children’s Privacy

The Extension is not directed to children under the age of 14 and does not knowingly collect their personal data. If we become aware that such data has been inadvertently collected, we will delete it without delay.

### 10. Chrome Web Store Compliance

This extension fully complies with the Chrome Web Store User Data policies, including the “Limited Use” requirements. Data is used only for the core functionality of the extension (PDF conversion and Pro feature management) and is never sold or used for unrelated purposes.

### 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any material changes will be announced clearly with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
