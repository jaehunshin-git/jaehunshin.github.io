**PDF to LLM Assistant**  
Last Updated: August 29, 2025

PDF to LLM Assistant (“the Extension”) takes your privacy seriously and complies with all relevant laws and Chrome Web Store policies. This document explains what information is processed, how, and why, when you use the Extension.

## 1. Core Principles of Data Processing  

- All processing of your PDF files and nearly all user data occurs **100% locally** on your computer/browser.
- No personal data is ever used for resale, personalized advertising, credit evaluation, or any non-essential purpose.

## 2. Personal Data Collected and Purposes  

The Extension **does not collect or persistently store any personal data** during ordinary use.  
However, in the limited context of **Pro license activation/restoration**, the following information may be handled temporarily:

| Context | Data Item | Purpose | Method | Retention Period |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| License Activation | License Key | Pro license validity check | Direct user entry | Deleted immediately after verification |
| Purchase Restoration | License Key, Email Address | Restore purchase record | Direct user entry | Deleted immediately after verification |
| Browser Sync Storage | Pro activation status (flag only) | Syncing Pro status across devices | Auto storage | Deleted upon deactivation or extension removal |

※ Users who do not wish to provide this information may simply choose not to use Pro features or purchase restoration.

## 3. Automatically Collected Data  

- The Extension **does not automatically collect or store** your PDF files, document contents, web browsing history, IP address, or location data.
- For Pro verification requests, meta data (e.g., request timestamps, server access logs) may be generated within Google Firebase/Cloud infrastructure; this is managed by the provider and is not used or held by the Extension itself.

## 4. Third-Party Data Handling and Sharing  

We do **not** share or delegate your personal data to third parties, except where strictly required as follows:

| Recipient / Vendor | Country | Transmitted Data | Purpose | Legal Basis | Retention Period |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gumroad Inc. (Payments) | USA | During purchase: payment info, email address | Pro purchase payment | Contract fulfillment | See Gumroad's policies |
| Google LLC (Firebase Functions) | Global | License Key, Email (for restoration) | Pro license check | Service operation | Deleted immediately after verification/restoration |

You may review each vendor’s privacy policy on their official websites.

## 5. International Data Transfers  

- During Pro purchase or license verification, data may be transmitted to the United States (Gumroad) or Google's global cloud infrastructure.
- Method: Securely encrypted (HTTPS/TLS) transfer at the time of request.
- Data is handled according to international standards and the respective vendors’ policies.

## 6. Data Retention and Disposal  

- Information entered for Pro activation/restoration is **deleted automatically immediately after use**.
- The Pro activation status is stored only within your browser and deleted on deactivation or uninstall.
- Any logs or records held by Google or Gumroad are subject to those companies’ own retention and disposal policies.

## 7. Data Subject Rights and How to Exercise Them  

- You may at any time request to access, correct, delete, restrict processing of, or withdraw consent for any personal data you have provided.
- Actions related to license info, purchase restoration, sync storage, and extension removal can be performed by you directly. For any additional issues, contact the Data Protection Officer below and action will be taken promptly.
- Any rights concerning data managed by Google or Gumroad must be exercised directly with those companies.

## 8. Data Security  

- All network transmissions are encrypted with HTTPS/TLS.
